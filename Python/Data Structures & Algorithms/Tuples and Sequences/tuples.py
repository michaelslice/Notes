# A tuple consists of a number of values 
# separated by commas, for instance 

t = 12345, 54321, 'hello'
t[0]
# 12345
# t (12345, 54321, 'hello')

v = ([1, 2, 3], [3, 2, 1])

# Output tuples are always enclosed in parentheses so that nested
# tuples are interpreted correctly

# How to declare a tuple with 0, or 1 items
singleton = 'hello', # <-- A single comma is valid
