Django Notes

include(): Is a function thast allows referencing other URLconfs. When Django encounters include(),
it chops off whatever part of the URL matched up to that point and sends the remaining string to the included URLconf for further processing

path(): Is a function that is passed four arguments, TWO REQUIRED route and view, and two optional kwargs and name

path() argument view: When Django finds a matching pattern it calls the specified view function with an Httprequest object as the first argument and any captured values from the route as keyword arguments

path() arguemetns kwargs: Arbitrayr keyword arguemetns can be passed in a dictionary to the target view 

path() argument: name: Naming your URL lets you refer to it unambioguosly from elsewhere in Django especially from within tempaltes

Each view is responsible for doing one of two things: returning an HttpResponse object containing the content for the requested page, or raising an exception such as Http404. The rest is up to you.
