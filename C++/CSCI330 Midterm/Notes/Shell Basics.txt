Shell Basics

To set a variable

varname = value

Print the variable

echo $varname

Set a alias 

alias ll="ls -l"

Remove alias

unalias ll

Shell History

!! - Runs last command

!5 - Runs the command at history 5

!-3 - Runs the command 3 commands ago

Run multiple commands at once 

date; pwd; ls



How backticks affect a command 

echo "Today's date is `date`"

Backticks can be used to encapsulate a command

$(command) Command Substitution

echo "User $(whoami) is on $(hostname)"

COMMAND SUBSTITUTION IS USEFUL IF YOU NEED TO RUN A COMMAND USING DATA THAT ANOTHER COMMAND PRINTS OUT

Automatically Appending the data to filenames
cp "$filename" "$filename$(date + %F)"
