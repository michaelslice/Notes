Fork: This system call is used to create a new process by duplicating the existing process.
The new process is called the child process, and it is an exact copy of the parent process,
exect as different return values.

The purpose of fork is to allow parallel execution of multiple processes, essential for parallel and multi tasking. 
After fork() the parent and child process continue exucution but they have different process id

Wait: This system call is used by a parent process to wait for the termination of its child process.
Parent is restarted once a child process terminates.

Exec: This system call is used to execute a new program in the context of the current procecss.
When a process calls exec(), it replaces its current code and data with a new program loaded from the disk.

The purpose of exec() is to allow processes to execute different programs dynamically. 
Commonly used when programs need to swich between different tasks or applications 




fork() : Is for creating new processes 
wait() : Is for synchronization and retrieving terminatio status of child processes 
exec() : Is for replacing the current process image with a new program
