File Descriptors

On UNIX, every program runs in a process, and each process has its own set of file descriptors,
positive integers that indicate open files.

0 - standard input (std::cin)
1 - standard output (std::cout)
2 - standard error (std::cerr)

eval - Command runs its command line arguements as if they had been typed at the shell on their own

space : Seperator for arguements
$ : Variable substitution
= : Variable assignment
!: History manipulation
; : Sequential execution
` $() : Command substitution
< > | : I/O redirection
& : Background execution
' " \ : Quoting/Escaping
# : Comment
* ! [] {} : Wildcards

Shell features like variable or command substitution do not function inside of single quotes 

echo "Yo what is up `yooooo`"

yooooo will not print 

atom - An atom indicates which text is to be matched and where is to be found
operator - Is used to combine regular expressions atoms
