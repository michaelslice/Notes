Link Notes

Hard Link - Share same inode as target
- Target file must exist upon creation
- Original file will continue to exist as long as any hard link to it exists.
- Cannot link to a file located on a different physical device.
- Cannot circulary link to another hard link.

Ex: ln shared_file link_name

Symbolic Link - Path to the target is stored 
- Can be created even before the target file exists
- Cannot access the target if it is missing or if the user doesnt have permissions for the file.
- Can link across physical file systems.
- Can be circularly linked to another symbolically linked file.

Ex: ln -s shared_file link_name
