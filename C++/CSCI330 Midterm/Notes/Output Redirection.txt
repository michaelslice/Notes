Output Redirection

Output Redirection - Allows the user to take control where the output of a command is sent.
By default the output is sent to the standard output(stdout), typically displayed in the terminal.

> : Redirects standard output to a file overwriting the file if it already exists.

ls > output_file.txt : Writes ls to output_file.txt and overwites content

>> : Redirects standard output to a file and appends the contents to the file if it already exists

ls >> output_file.txt

Input Redirection - Allows you to change the source of input for a command. By default a command 
reads input from the terminal 

sort < file.txt : The shell reads input from the file instead of from the terminal 

HERE DOCUMNET COMMAND 

cat << EOF : When this command is run the shell keeps requesting input until the word "EOF" is run
