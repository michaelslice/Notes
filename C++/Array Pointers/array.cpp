#include <iostream>

/**
 *
 *  @note The elements of a one dimensional array are effectively a series of individual variables of the array data type, stored
 *  one after another in the computers memory. The address of the array is the address of the first elemen, which is the address
 *  of the first byte of memory occupied by the array.
 *
 * @note 2D arrays in cpp are stored in contigous blocks of memory, with row 0 followed by the elements of row 1, row 2, etc.
 *
 * @note Usually in cpp, the compiler implicitly generates a pointer to the first element of the array. For example
 * int scores, is represented as a pointer to an int.
 *
 * @note Arrays in cpp are passed by address, therefore when passing arrays to functions, the values changed will effect the original array.
