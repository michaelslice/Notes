Least Optimal 

O(n!)
O(2^n)
O(n^3)

More Optimal

O(n^2) - Quadratic Complexity - Grows quadratically
O(n Log n) - Log-Linear time complexity - 
O(n) - Linear time complexity - Grows linear with input
O(sqrt(n)) - square root of n complexity - Grows proportional to the square root of the input size
O(log n) - Logarithmic time complexity 
O(1) - Constant time complexity, efficiency is constant 



O(1) - Constant time - 
Accessing an element in array by index, 
inserting or deleting a element at the beginning or end of a array.
looking up a element in a array

O(n) - Linear time complexity - 
Calculating the sum of a array
looping through array
insert element in middle, remove middle, search
