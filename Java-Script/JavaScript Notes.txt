JavaScript Notes

Datatypes:
	Numbers
	Strings
	Boolean
	Array
	Object

Variables:
	var: variable keyword, that is global
	let: Can be updated but not redeclared, variable only exists within its scope so you can reuse the name in different scope, block scoped
	const: Stands for constant, const is similar to let in that it is block scoped
<script> tag:
	Allows you to write Java script code in HTML

	<script src="app.js"> </script>

Functions:
	Function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name

	function add(): void {};

Arrow-Functions:
	const doSomething = () => {}

const names = ["Pedro", "Jack", "Jose"]
const names2  = [...names, "Joel"];

	names2 is equal to all the names in names, and "Joel"

Manipulating Arrays:

	.map(): Will iterate through a array
	names.map((name) => { console.log(name)};

	.filter(): Will filter an array based on a condition
