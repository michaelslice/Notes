5. Simple SELECT Queries

SELECT query:
	SELECT column, another_column,...
	FROM myTable
	WHERE condition(s)
	ORDER BY column ASC/DESC
	LIMIT num_limit OFFSET num_offset

6. Multi-table Queries with JOINS

Tables that share information about a single entity need to have a PRIMARY KEY that identifies that entity uniquely across the database.  

A common primary key type is an auto-incrementing integer (because they are space efficient),
but it can also be a string, hashed value

Using the JOIN clause in a query we can combine row data across two separate tables using this unique key

INNER JOIN: Is a process that matches rows from the first table and the second table which have the same key (as defined by ON constraint) to create a result row with the combined columns from both tables.

Select Query with INNER JOIN on multiple tables:
	SELECT column, another_table_column,
	FROM myTABLE
	INNER JOIN another_table
		ON mytable.id = another_table.id
	WHERE condition(s)
	ORDER BY column, … ASC/DESC
	LIMIT num_limit OFFSET num_offset 

7. OUTER JOINS

If two tables have asymmetric data, which can easily happen when data is entered in different stages, then we would have to use a LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, or FULL JOIN instead to ensure that the data you need is not left of the results.

SELECT Query with LEFT/RIGHT/FULL JOINS on multiple tables
	SELECT column, another_column, …
	FROM myTABLE
	INNER/LEFT/RIGHT/FULL JOIN another_table
		ON mytable.id = another_table.matching_id
	WHERE condtion(s)
	ORDER BY column,
	LIMIT num_limit OFFSET num_offset

Like the INNER JOIN these three new joins have to specify which column to join the data on.
When joining table A to table B, a LEFT JOIN simply includes rows from A regardless of whether a matching row is found in B. The RIGHT JOIN is the same but reversed, keeping rows in B regardless of whether a match is found in A. Finally a FULL JOIN simply means that rows from both tables are kept, regardless of whether a matching row exists in the other table.

8. NULLS

An alternate to NULL values in a database is to have data-type appropriate default values, like 0 for numerical data, empty strings for text, etc. 

Select Query with Constraints on NULL values:
	SELECT column, another_column,...
	FROM meetable
	WHERE column IS/IS NOT NULL
	AND/OR another_condition
	AND/OR...;
