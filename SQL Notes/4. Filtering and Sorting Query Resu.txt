4. Filtering and Sorting Query Results

DISTINCT: Is a keyword used to remove duplicate column values

Select Query with Unique Results:
	SELECT DISTINCT column, another_column,...
	FROM myTABLE
	WHERE condtion(s);

Ordering Results:

ORDER BY: Is a keyword used to sort results in a column, in ascending or descending order

Select Query with Ordered Results:
	SELECT column, another_column,...
	FROM myTABLE
	WHERE condition(s)
	ORDER BY column ASC/DESC

Limiting Results to a Subset:

LIMIT: Will reduce the number of rows to return

OFFSET: Will specify where to begin counting the number rows from

Select Query with Limited Rows:
	SELECT column, another_column,...
	FROM myTABLE
	WHERE condtion(s)
	ORDER BY column ASC/DESC
	LIMIT num_limit OFFESET num_offeset;
